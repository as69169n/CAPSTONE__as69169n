## Overview

**Predicting Heart Disease Risk Using Hypothesis Testing and Machine Learning** is a project aimed at predicting the likelihood of heart disease in individuals based on various health indicators such as cholesterol levels, blood pressure, age, and more. The project combines statistical hypothesis testing and machine learning techniques to identify key risk factors and build predictive models that can assist in early diagnosis.

Key objectives include:
- Performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover trends and relationships in the data.
- Using **hypothesis testing** to validate assumptions about the influence of specific features like cholesterol and blood pressure on heart disease.
- Training several **machine learning models** (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests) to predict heart disease risk.
- Evaluating the models' performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

The overall goal is to create a tool that aids in identifying high-risk individuals, potentially contributing to more timely interventions and improved patient outcomes.
